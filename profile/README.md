# LLM-as-an-Interviewer
This is the official GitHub repository for [LLM-AS-AN-INTERVIEWER: Beyond Static Testing Through Dynamic LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10424).

LLM-as-an-Interviewer is an evaluation framework that assesses the capabilities of LLMs through an interview-style process. In this approach, the LLM acting as the interviewer evaluates other LLMs by providing feedback and asking follow-up questions, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities.

Our framework includes a flexible pipeline that can be easily adapted to various tasks by incorporating a customized evaluation rubric.
